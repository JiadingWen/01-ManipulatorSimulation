## Introduction
This project mainly simulates four control algorithms
1. Linear Camera Space Manipulation (LCSM)
2. Image-Based Visual Servo with monocular vision system (Monocular IBVS)
3. Image-Based Visual Servo with binocular vision system (Binocular IBVS)
4. Position-Based Visual Servo with binocular vision system (Binocular PBVS)
These algorithms are applied to a virtual PUMA robot manipulator on Matlab with Robotics Toolbox.
